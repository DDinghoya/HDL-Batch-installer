  <summary> <b> Wich Program should I use to load my games after installing them? </b> </summary>

__Note:__ There was a regression on OPL 1.1.0 regarding internal HDD, you can still give it a try... however, [OPL v1.0.0](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/releases/tag/v1.0.0) is recommended for stability

  <summary> <b> How can I use a custom OSD icon for my games? </b> </summary>
    <p>
      
Take the desired custom icon and place it on the program folder (where `boot.kelf` resides) and name it as `list.ico`
      
Note: starting with `v3.1.3 - revision 0` make sure you disabled custom icon loader, otherwise, your icon will be deleted

The old hdl server has been broken for years.
OPL replaced internal HDL Server with NBD Server (by @bignaux), the advantage of NBD server is that there's no need to change anything on my program to make it compatible

Just setup NBD server and the program should recognize the HDD 
      
if you donÂ´t know how to do it, take a look at the [__OPL readme__](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader#introduction)
